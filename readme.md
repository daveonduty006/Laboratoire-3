## **Python Project #3**
### 'The Card Deck Shuffling Program' ###
***
*working with  loops and data presentation/alignment*
***

### Description ###
    This third project is the creation of a 52-card deck shuffling program. Using loops, the deck cards are generated using the contents of two lists (ranks, suits). 
    A menu is then presented to the user with four options: displaying the state of the deck, riffle-shuffling the deck, overhand-shuffling the deck and saving the state of the deck within a file/exiting the program. 
    The deck can be shuffled as many time as the user want and the cards, once displayed-on-the-console/written-in-the-file, must all be perfectly aligned without any brackets, commas and quotes (no traces of the code object).

### Steps of the Project ###
    
    ** Step 1 **
    Create a deck of 52 cards (using lists). The generated cards must initially be in the deck list in ascending order: 1-to-13/A-to-K in the order of diamonds -> clubs -> hearts > spades.

    ** Step 2 **
    Create a looping menu to the user with the following options: 
    1. Display the deck state
    2. Riffle-shuffle the deck
    3. Overhand-shuffle the deck
    4. Save the final deck state in a file
    The user should be able the shuffle the deck as many times as he want.

    ** Step 3 **
    Create a way to display the state of the deck on the console. All cards must be displayed in a readable format.

    ** Step 4 **
    Create a way to shuffle the cards with the riffle method. The order of the cards should be: [P1-Card1, P2-Card1, P1-Card2, P2-Card2, etc]

    ** Step 5 **
    Create a way to shuffle the cards with the overhand method. The cards should be subdivided in 13 packs with an equal number of cards each and then rearranged in this order: [P7,P1,P3,P13,P2,P4,P11,P6,P8,P5,P12,P10,P9].

    ** Step 6 **
    Create a way to save the final state of the deck inside a .txt file named 'cards'. Like when displayed at the console with option 1, the cards should be written in a readable format without any traces of the object code (no brackets, commas, quotes, etc). 
    The program should then be ended right after the file write.
